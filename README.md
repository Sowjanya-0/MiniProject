# MiniProject
## ABSTRACT
The colorization of black and white photos has been a more researched area in past years because to the emergence of deep convolutional neural networks. This method is being used to colourizer images that have been downloaded from the internet. Previous research has mostly concentrated on the colorization of a small number of photos, whereas colorization of a wide range of images has traditionally been achieved with manual scribbles.

The method is fully automated process. This project build analyses two different convolutional neural network architectures for implementing it, each trained with a different loss function. On the basis of the individual imaging results, each variant is compared.In this model is an outperformed some classic RGB colorization approaches.
